This repository collects a set of tools to apply machine learning techniques to coarse grain atomic systems.


Installation
------------
.. start-install
The dependencies are defined in `requirements.txt` but some packages are not well handled by pip. So start by installing `pytorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ and `pytorch-geometric <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ with conda, e.g.::

    conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
    conda install pyg -c pyg -c conda-forge

Support for the MACE model can be enabled with::

    pip install git+https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace.git

Support for the TorchMD-Net models can be enabled with::

    pip install git+https://github.com/torchmd/torchmd-net.git

.. end-install

CLI
---

The models defined in this library can be convinietly trained using the pytorch-lightning
`CLI <https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/common/lightning_cli.html>`_ utilities.

Examples
--------

Please take a look into the examples folder to see how to use this code to train a model over an existing dataset.

How to update the online documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This udapte should be done after any update of the `main` branch so that the
documentation is synchronised with the main version of the repository.
